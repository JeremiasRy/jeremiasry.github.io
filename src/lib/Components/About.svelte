    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>For practice and fun I have written some ASCII games.</p>
    <p>Current focus is on DSP and C++</p>
    <p>There's more different projects in my <a href="https://github.com/JeremiasRy" target="_blank"><b>gitHub</b></a> but I think these give a good representation of my skills.</p>
    <p>I consider my strong suite to be the background logic of all things. Designing UX/UI needs work (as you can see from this page...)</p>
    <p>This page was built with svelte.</p>
